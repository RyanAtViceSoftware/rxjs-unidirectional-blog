Writing webpack configs is brittle and error-prone. This package provides a [joi](https://github.com/hapijs/joi) object schema for webpack configs. This gets you a) static type safety, b) property spell checking and c) semantic validations such as "`loader` and `loaders` can not be used simultaneously" or "`query` can only be used with `loader`, not with `loaders`".

You're very welcome to give [feedback](https://github.com/js-dxtools/webpack-validator/issues) & [PR's](https://github.com/js-dxtools/webpack-validator).

### Example
Take this simple webpack config. It has a tiny, hard to spot error. Can you find it?
```js
var config = {
  module: {
    loaders: [
      { test: /\.js$/, loaders: 'babel-loader', exclude: /node_modules/ }
    ]
  },
  output: {
    library: 'Redux',
    libraryTarget: 'umd'
  },
  plugins: [
    new webpack.optimize.OccurenceOrderPlugin(),
    new webpack.DefinePlugin({
      'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify(env)
    })
  ]
};
```

webpack-validator makes it easy:

### Usage
There are two ways to use webpack-validator: a) "programmatically" by wrapping your webpack config object with a validation function or b) by using a command line interface.

For the first approach, add this in your `webpack.config.js`:
```js
const validate = require('webpack-validator')

module.exports = validate({ /* ... your webpack config */ })
```
Now run webpack. Either everything is green and the build continues or `joi` will let you know what's wrong and the build won't continue.

#### CLI
For CLI usage you probably want to install the tool globally (`npm install -g webpack-validator`) first. Then just run `webpack-validator <your-config>`.

#### Customizing
If you need to extend the schema, for example for custom top level properties or properties added by third party plugins like `eslint-loader` (which adds a toplevel `eslint` property), do it like this:

```js
const validate = require('webpack-validator')
const schema = require('webpack-validator').schema

// joi is installed as dependency of this package and will be available in node_modules
// if you use npm 3. Otherwise install it explicitly.
const Joi = require('joi')

const yourSchema = schema.concat(Joi.object({
  // this would just allow the property and doesn't perform any additional validation
  eslint: Joi.any()
}))

const config = { /* ... your webpack config */ }

// Override default config by supplying your config as second parameter.
module.exports = validate(config, yourSchema)
```

#### Quiet Mode
If you want to mute console output apart from errors, set `--quiet` or `validate(config, yourSchema, {quiet: true})`. This is particularly useful if you are using webpack `--json` as you'll want to avoid writing additional text to the JSON output.

#### Advanced Usage
If you need to access the validation results directly and want to control the side-effects (i.e. console.log output, `process.exit(1)` on fail behaviour) yourself, you can call the validation function like so: `validate(config, yourSchema, { returnValidation: true })`. This will make 1) the function return the validation results instead of your configuration and 2) not perform any side effects.

#### Support
Because this module uses the amazing `Joi` validation library, this module only supports Node >=4.0.0.
